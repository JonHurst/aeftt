    <h1>Supporting Development</h1>

    <p>Development of the All Engine Failure Training Tool already represents over 100
    hours of effort.</p>

    <p>There is more functionality that I would like to add. For example, an option to
    assume the yellow hydraulic system has been recovered would be extremely
    useful. Unfortunately, there is no relevant glide ratio data for this in the QRH; I
    would need to extract it from a certified simulator. This would be costly, both in
    terms of money and time.</p>

    <p>There are also plenty of opportunities for other web browser based simulations. My
    original technology demonstrator, <a
    href="https://hursts.org.uk/models/fuel-system.html">a model of the A320 low pressure
    fuel system</a>, is an example of the sort of thing that can be built.</p>

    <p>I am keen to progress this work, but there is a limit to how much effort I can
    justify without financial reward. If, either as an individual or as an organisation,
    you feel that access to these resources is valuable, I would greatly appreciate it if
    you would consider supporting their development.</p>

    <p>Many thanks.</p>
