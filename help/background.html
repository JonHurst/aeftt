    <h1>AEFTT background information</h1>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>

    <p>The All Engine Failure Training Tool is a simplified physics and aerodynamics
    model that has been tuned to replicate the three glide ratios published in the
    QRH All Engine Failure procedure for a 60 Tonne Airbus A320.</p>

    <p>I built it to explore energy management and navigational strategy in the event of All Engine
    Failure. I have found it useful for this purpose, and release it in the hope that others may also
    find it useful. <span class="redspan">Use it <em>entirely</em> at your own risk.</span></p>

    <p>I have no special access to Airbus technical information beyond that which is
    available to any A320 line pilot. The “Drag Curves” section below describes how
    aircraft behaviour has been inferred from the small amount of publicly available
    information. Some of the inferences are a bit of a stretch. It is up to the
    individual user to decide how useful the resulting simulation is to them.</p>

    <p>I <em>strongly</em> recommend that any strategy that you may develop through the use of
    this simulation is validated in a certified flight simulator.</p>

    <h2>Modelling</h2>

    <h3>Drag curves</h3>

    <p>Gliding flight is all about energy transfer. The aircraft has potential energy
    by virtue of its position and it has kinetic energy by virtue of its
    velocity. This energy is continuously being transferred to the environment in
    the form of work done against drag.</p>

    <p>Replication of aircraft behaviour, therefore, is primarily a matter of knowing
    the drag force. Unfortunately, drag data for commercial aircraft is not made
    publicly available by manufacturers.</p>

    <p>All is not lost, however. The QRH publishes both minimum drag speed for a clean
    aircraft (a.k.a. green dot speed) and a glide ratio at that speed. With those two
    data points and some standard aerodynamic equations it is possible to produce a
    drag curve that should be a good representation of the drag for a clean aircraft
    throughout the normal flight envelope. Some confidence in the validity of this
    technique is given by the fact that the glide ratio for windmill relight speed,
    also available in the QRH, emerges from such modelling without additional effort.</p>

    <p>Airbus also publishes a final approach glide ratio at a weight dependent final approach
    speed. The configuration for this is gear emergency extended, slat 2.</p>

    <p>The induced drag coefficient (k in the equation C<sub>D</sub> = C<sub>D0</sub> +
    kC<sub>L</sub><sup>2</sup>) is mainly a function of aspect ratio, and thus is little changed by
    slat deployment. If it is considered to be constant, the published glide ratio is solely a
    result of the increase in form drag coefficient (C<sub>D0</sub>) associated with gear and slat
    deployment. A good representation of the drag curve in this configuration can therefore be found
    by modifying the clean drag curve by increasing C<sub>D0</sub> until the published final
    approach glide ratio is achieved at the specified speed.</p>

    <p>Beyond this, things get much sketchier. We need the drag curve for any
    combination of gear and slat. The first step is to split out the effects of gear
    and slat 2 from the final approach configuration. In the absence of a better
    idea, I turned to the fuel penalty factor charts. From these we find flight with
    gear extended has a fuel penalty factor of 180%, whereas flight with full slat
    extended has a penalty of 60%. If it is assumed that slat 1 would be 20% penalty
    and slat 2 would be 40% penalty, it could be claimed that the gear accounts for
    about 4.5 times the drag of slat 2. From this, admittedly somewhat iffy,
    process, drag curves for all the available combinations of gear and slat are
    produced.</p>

    <p>Examples of the relative drag curves produced by this process are shown here:</p>

    <img alt="Drag Curves" src="drag-curves.png" />

    <p>Finally, and most sketchy of all, the contribution of the speedbrake needs to be
    estimated. The fuel penalty factor is not useful in this case, so I have,
    somewhat arbitrarily, estimated that the speedbrake, when all the spoilers are
    available, produces about a third of the drag of the gear. With only a third of
    the spoilers available, then, the fully deployed speedbrake is estimated to
    provide just one ninth of the drag of the gear, which is the same as I have
    estimated for each stage of slat. The FCTM does suggest the use of speedbrakes
    for forced landing, so it can be inferred that they have at least some useful
    effect.</p>

    <p>Airbus released a Flight Operations Briefing Note titled “Aircraft Energy
    Management during Approach” in October 2005. There are two interesting details in this
    briefing note. Firstly, that V<sub>LS</sub> is slightly on the back of the “power
    curve” and secondly that the curve near V<sub>LS</sub> is “rather flat”. Carrying out
    a landing performance calculation with flaps locked at zero and slat 2 gives a
    V<sub>APP</sub> of 155kt with no approach correction, meaning V<sub>LS</sub> is
    approximately 155kt with this configuration. 155kt on the green curve is indeed
    slightly on the back of the curve and the curve is rather flat there. This gives a
    modicum of confidence.</p>

    <p>An additional issue in all this, of course, is that a real A320 having suffered
    All Engine Failure may not behave like the QRH says it will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The glide ratios published in the QRH are suspiciously round numbers. They may
        represent a very approximate version of the real performance.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Flaps may become available. The ECAM will eventually suggest reinstatement of
        the yellow hydraulic system with a combination of the APU and the yellow
        electric pump. This would significantly change the glide ratio in the final
        approach phase, which, in the QRH, is based on slats only.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is likely that whatever happened to cause the all engine failure (e.g. multiple bird
        strike) would have caused other damage to the aircraft which may make the real glide ratios
        worse than published.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aircraft Weight</h3>

    <p>The modelling is, arbitrarily, for a 60 Tonne aircraft. The question arises,
    then, of how useful is it if the aircraft weight is substantially different from
    this.</p>

    <p>The first thing to note is that, to a reasonable approximation, gliding
    performance is not dependent on weight. This is what allows Airbus to publish a
    single value for glide at minimum drag speed and another single value for glide
    at approach speed. What changes is the value of those speeds, not the glide
    ratios.</p>

    <p>There <em>are</em> areas where the effect of aircraft weight can be felt. The radius of
    turns will be higher at heavier weights, for example, meaning that the cost of
    those turns will be higher. The approach speed will be higher at higher weights
    which means you have less margin to tyre limiting speed should you find yourself
    high and wanting to transfer some potential energy to kinetic. All in all,
    though, these effects should be fairly limited, and a strategy that is effective
    for a 60 Tonne aircraft should be equally effective for other weights.</p>

    <h2>My Strategy</h2>

    <p>This section discusses the strategy that I have evolved. I make no claim that it is
    the best available strategy. <span class="redspan">I include it only in the hope that
    the information may be useful, not as a recommendation to adopt the same
    methods.</span></p>

    <h3>Estimating glide-slope</h3>

    <p>Pilots rightly fear undershooting, so tend to “eyeball” an overly steep glide. With
    the flatness of the drag curve at approach speeds and the limited availability of
    methods of modifying glide ratio, once you commit to a glide that is significantly
    wrong there is little that can be done to rectify the situation.</p>

    <p>The key is to be on a decent approximation of the “correct” glide-slope, then trade
    potential and kinetic energy to make micro adjustments.</p>

    <p>The starting point for estimating the “correct” glide-slope is the figure from the
    QRH, i.e. 600ft per nautical mile. Wind has a significant effect, and needs to be
    accounted for, as does the pseudo-force due to the wind gradient. I use a ballpark of
    an extra 50ft per nautical mile per 10kt average headwind. You also need to account
    for whether you have arranged that you will have flaps available. If so, I add another
    50ft per nautical mile.</p>

    <p>With an estimate of the cost of each nautical mile in feet, it is possible to write
    down the altitudes versus distances for the glide you are hoping to fly. You start
    with airfield elevation at 0nm and increment by your estimate for each mile back up
    the slope.</p>

    <h3>Soft target</h3>

    <p>The approach is split into two phases:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The first phase is initially flown clean at green dot, then slat 1 at s
        speed. Energy is managed in this phase by manipulating track mileage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The second phase is along the inbound track, flown gear down, slat 2 (maybe
        flap 2 also if you have so arranged) and vertical position is primarily managed
        by trading potential and kinetic energies.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>What you are aiming to arrange is for the aircraft to simultaneously meet your
    calculated glide-slope and complete the transition to gear down, slat 2.</p>

    <p>To help achieve this, a target position on the glide-slope is nominated. The focus
    of the first phase is to be inbound on the extended centre-line, slat 1, s speed, such
    that the aircraft would meet the glide-slope at the target position. If sufficient
    energy is available, 5nm seems to work well, but a closer in target may be required if
    things are tight.</p>

    <p>As you approach the glide-slope, you then shift your focus to timing the deployment
    of gear and slat 2. The reason I refer to the first phase target as soft is that
    modest errors are easily absorbed at this point. If you got yourself a bit high, you
    meet the glide-slope a bit earlier, if you got yourself a bit low, a bit
    later. Obviously, the closer in your target is, the less error you can absorb this
    way.</p>

    <h3>First Phase</h3>

    <p>The first question to be answered is whether a suitable airfield can be
    reached. Your still air range at green dot is two and a half times your altitude
    in thousands of feet, e.g. if you are at 36,000ft your still air range is 2.5 x
    36 = 90 nautical miles. It is difficult to properly account for wind as both the
    wind and your true airspeed will be changing significantly throughout the
    descent, but tailwinds are obviously to be preferred.</p>

    <p>Time spent at windmill relight speeds will significantly reduce your potential
    still air range. It is not impossible that there could be situations where attempts to
    windmill relight would leave you unable to reach a satisfactory airfield.</p>

    <p>If a suitable airfield can be reached, an estimated glide-slope is created and
    a first phase target is nominated as described above.</p>

    <p>In order to manage track mileage, I have found the simplest method is the use of
    variable length holding patterns. As a ballpark figure, each 90° turn costs
    1000ft. Note that this is conservative at low altitudes and overly optimistic at high
    altitudes due to the higher true airspeed and thus larger radii of turns as altitude
    increases. Thus, each 180° turn will cost about 2000ft. The level segments cost 400ft
    for each nautical mile, as per the QRH. With a suitable selection of level segment
    length, the target can usually be achieved with an error of less than a few hundred
    feet.</p>

    <p>If there is not sufficient spare energy for holding patterns, another useful
    technique is adjusting the position of the intercept of the final approach track. If
    the intercept angle is around 90° and you are a reasonable distance away from it, the
    distance flown to the start of the inbound turn is not greatly affected by the
    intercept distance. Bearing in mind that the 90° turn will cost around 1000ft, a
    suitable intercept distance can be found such that any excess energy is used up.</p>

    <h3>Second Phase</h3>

    <p>The second phase is the final glide to a landing. The gear has been emergency extended and
    cannot be retracted and config 2 is selected.</p>

    <p>In the scenario considered by the QRH, only blue hydraulics are available. That
    means no flaps and only a third of the speedbrake.</p>

    <p>In this scenario, selecting config 3 does nothing — the slat position is the same
    in config 2 and config 3. Selecting config full prevents the use of speedbrake, so,
    assuming the increase in drag from slat 3 to slat full is similar to that provided by
    the remaining speedbrake, also gains nothing. That leaves the speedbrake, or the third
    of it that remains at least, as the only method of achieving a, fairly minimal,
    increase in glide angle.</p>

    <p>Selecting config 1 is a viable method of achieving a slight decrease in glide
    angle: landing performance calculations show that with flaps stuck at zero, approach
    speeds are the same for slat 1 to 3 inclusive.</p>

    <p>Things are somewhat better if you can reinstate the yellow hydraulics. The ECAM
    will eventually instruct you to do so, but only once the pressure derived from the
    windmilling engines drops sufficiently, so it may be worth sorting it out earlier. You
    will need the APU online, and you will need to turn the PTU off as the yellow electric
    pump is not sufficiently capable to power the green system through the PTU.</p>

    <p>With the yellow hydraulics you get flaps and all the spoilers associated with the
    speedbrake. This should give significantly more capability for increasing glide angle
    if required. Once on the ground, it also gives you more ground spoilers and better
    braking capability.</p>

    <p>I have not been able to model behaviour with the yellow hydraulics available as
    there is no relevant data in the QRH on which to base the drag model. I am keen to
    offer this as an option in the future; if there is sufficient interest, I will rent a
    suitable certified fixed based sim in order to extract the drag model for these
    configurations.</p>

    <p>What <em>is</em> highly effective in this phase is direct trading of potential and
    kinetic energy. This chart attempts to put some figures to such trade-offs:</p>

    <img alt="Energy trade-off" src="energy-trade.png"/>

    <p>For example, reducing true airspeed from 180kt to 170kt is equivalent to about a
    155ft climb, from 170kt to 160kt about another 145ft. So by reducing speed within a
    reasonable range we can effectively increase our altitude by about 300ft. For an
    increase in speed from 180kt to 200kt we can decrease our effective altitude by a
    little more than that. Note that this is independent of aircraft weight, or, indeed,
    being an aircraft at all. With this in mind, flying the approach at 15kt or so above the
    published V<sub>APP</sub> provides some useful error margin.</p>

    <p>Over 5nm, ±300ft is equivalent to about ±0.56°. That gives us at least some leeway
    should our estimated glide-slope be slightly out. About ±0.18° is also available from
    accepting a landing 300m either side of the aiming point; if a particularly long
    runway is available, moving the aiming point to 600m into the runway would double
    this.</p>

    <p>With this energy trading, it is quite possible that you will arrive at the
    touchdown zone with significant excess speed. This is far preferable to landing long
    — wheel brakes are much more effective at dissipating kinetic energy than aerodynamic
    drag. It is also worth bearing in mind that some excess energy is going to be required
    to reduce the descent rate to more normal levels just prior to the flare.</p>
